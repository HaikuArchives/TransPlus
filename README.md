Original Creator: http://sourceforge.net/projects/transplus/

Here is the original ReadMe:

-------Installing-------------------------
1. Copy TransPlus.so to /boot/beos/system/lib
2. Place HTML in /boot/home/config/add-ons/Translators

------Using the source-------------
NOTE: The x86 projects were built with a cross-compiler. They may not compile in BeIDE on an x86 machine. Just switch the library paths, and it should work.

Everything is commented pretty extensively, so it should be obvious what everything does. If you don't understand, e-mail at NathanWhitehorn@kagi.com

If anyone can get pullSEInfo to work in the PlainText translator to work, they deserve a lot of praise.

Translators that should be written:
	-XML
	-RTF
	-MS Word
	-Star Office
	-WordPerfect
	-Gobe Productive
	-And anything else
